# classic-tetris-ai
AI for the original NES version of Tetris

## Installation
Install [nes-py](https://github.com/Kautenja/nes-py). Note that nes-py doesn't seem to support python 3.9 at the time of writing (at least on Windows).

## Running
Note: you will need a copy of NES Tetris in the `roms` folder. For copyright reasons, we cannot provide it nor can we provide instructions on how to get it.

To test, run:

`nes_py -r ./roms/Tetris.nes`

The emulator should open to the title sequence of the game.
